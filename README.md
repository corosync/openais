### Overview
OpenAIS was an open implementation of the
Application Interface Specification (AIS) provided by the Service Availability Forum
(SAForum or SA). SAForum defines a set of services for making highly available applications.
AIS is the interface a program uses.

Currently it's unmaintained and it's moved to GitHub for archive reasons because fedorahosted is planned for shutdown.

As a actively maintained replacement use [Corosync](http://corosync.github.io/corosync/).
